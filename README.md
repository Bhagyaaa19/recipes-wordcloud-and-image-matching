# recipes-wordcloud and image-matching
Data science project in requirement for partial completion of Data Analytics course work

A combined data science and computer-vision project which involved preprocessing a real-world recipe dataset, building TF–IDF based visualizations and word clouds, developing a recommendation engine, programmatic classification using OpenAI GPT-3, and implementing SIFT/ORB feature matching in OpenCV to compare image-matching methods.

• Natural language preprocessing and TF–IDF based word-cloud visualization of recipe ingredients.

• Automated classification via OpenAI GPT-3 to extract "make-with-kids" recommendations.

• Recipe recommendation using cosine similarity on ingredient TF–IDF vectors (top-12 recommendations for a preference profile).

• Image feature matching with SIFT and ORB; saved sift-result.jpg and orb-result.jpg.

• Comparative PDF report summarizing performance and tradeoffs between SIFT and ORB methods.
