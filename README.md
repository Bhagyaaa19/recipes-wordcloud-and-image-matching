# recipes-wordcloud and image-matching
Data science project in requirement for partial completion of Data Analytics course work

Implemented a combined data science and computer vision project that involved text preprocessing, TF–IDF based word-cloud visualization, building a personalized recipe recommendation system, automated recipe classification with GPT-3, and feature matching using SIFT/ORB in OpenCV with a comparative performance analysis.

• Natural language preprocessing and TF–IDF based word-cloud visualization of recipe ingredients.

• Automated classification via OpenAI GPT-3 to extract "make-with-kids" recommendations.

• Recipe recommendation system ors (top-12 recommendations for a preference profile).

• Image feature matching with SIFT and ORB; saved sift-result.jpg and orb-result.jpg.

• Comparative PDF report summarizing performance and tradeoffs between SIFT and ORB methods.
